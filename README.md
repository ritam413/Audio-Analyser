**1. Introduction**

-   **App Overview**:
    > The Audio Analyzer App provides real-time audio visualization and transcription for users. It uses WebRTC for live audio streaming and a Python backend for speech-to-text processing. Users can join rooms for shared sessions or upload audio files for transcription.

-   **Technologies Used**:
    ```yaml
    Frontend:
      - JavaScript (Vanilla)
      - HTML5 & CSS3 (Styled UI with Canvas Visualization)
      - WebRTC (Audio Streaming)

    Backend:
      - Python 3.9.10 (Flask, SpeechRecognition, ffmpeg-python)
      - Node.js v22.1.0 (WebSocket signaling server)

    Hosting & Deployment:
      - Netlify (Frontend)
      - Railway (Dockerized Signaling & Transcription Services)
    ```

-   **Target Audience**:
    > Developers working with real-time audio systems, musicians, data scientists, educators, and users interested in speech recognition.

**2. Installation Instructions**

-   **Prerequisites**:
    ```bash
    Node.js v22.1.0
    Python 3.9.10
    ```
    
    Required Libraries:
    ```txt
    # Python
    flask==2.3.2
    flask-cors==3.0.10
    gunicorn==20.1.0
    speechrecognition==3.10.0
    ffmpeg-python==0.2.0

-   **Steps to Install**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-analyzer.git
    cd audio-analyzer

    # Install Node dependencies
    npm install

    # Install Python dependencies

**3. App Architecture**

-   **Frontend**:
    > Uses WebRTC to capture live audio and draw the waveform on an HTML5 Canvas. UI includes tabs for live transcription and audio file upload.

-   **Backend**:
    > A Flask-based Python server that receives audio (WAV, MP3, etc.), converts it using ffmpeg, and transcribes using Google Speech Recognition via `speech_recognition`.

-   **WebRTC Integration**:
    > WebSocket signaling server handles peer room management and communication. Transcription and visualization happen locally with shared session control.

-   **Flow Diagram** (to be added visually):
    ```
    [User Mic] → [WebRTC Stream] → [Frontend Canvas + Recorder] → [Flask Backend] → [Transcription]
                           ↘
                            ↘ [WebSocket Server] → [Other Users]
    ```

**4. Features and Functionality**

-   **🎙️ Microphone Input**:
    > Captures live mic input using WebRTC and streams audio.

-   **📈 Audio Visualization**:
    > Visualizes real-time waveform on canvas with smooth animation.

-   **📝 Transcription**:
    > Upload audio or record live. Backend returns Google-transcribed text.

-   **🧑‍💻 User Interface**:
    ```
    - Tabs: Live / Upload
    - Waveform visualizer
    - Room join/create for live group sessions
    - Buttons: Record, Pause, Cancel, Confirm
    - Transcription viewer with Copy/Download
    ```

**5. Usage Instructions**

-   **How to Use**:
    ```
    1. Open the app in your browser.
    2. Click "Start Listening" to begin live recording.
    3. View waveform in real-time.
    4. Confirm or Cancel recording.
    5. Transcribed text will appear below.
    6. Or switch to "Upload" tab to transcribe an audio file.
    ```

-   **Troubleshooting**:
    ```
    - Ensure microphone access is allowed.
    - Make sure your browser supports WebRTC.
    - Server down? Check WebSocket and Flask URLs.
    ```

---

**6. Testing and Debugging**

-   **Unit Tests**:
    > Backend tested with `pytest` (for API), and mock audio files. Frontend tested manually via browser sessions.

-   **Known Bugs/Issues**:
    ```
    - Minor transcription delay due to network.
    - Some mic devices may need refresh to reconnect.
    ```

---

**7. Future Enhancements**

-   **✨ Planned Features**:
    ```
    - Multi-language transcription
    - Whisper integration for offline mode
    - User login & transcript history
    ```

-   **⚙️ Scalability**:
    > Horizontal scaling via multiple signaling servers; backend load balanced using Docker services (see `render.yaml`).
